# SimpleURL-Rotator
This is a simple urls rotator that uses cookies to go through one by one, and when there are no more, the default url will be loaded. Simple, but useful if you want to take better advantage of your traffic to show them advertising from different companies.

It could easily be adapted to Banners, I will surely implement it if I see that someone finds it useful.
